# vanilla-js-router

### What is this project?

It is a library for client-side routing that is independent of any other frameworks or libraries. It was created to be used for a single page application is designed to be flexible and lightweight. It provides the functionality of something like react-router without the bloat of using something like the react library. It uses template literals or dom elements as components for each different view. Along with this repository there is also an example application [here](https://github.com/daleighan/vanilla-js-router-example-app) that may be useful in deciphering how to use this .
